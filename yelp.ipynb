We have heard that their wings are great and decided it was finally time to check it out. Their wings are whole wings and crispy, which is a nice change of pace. I got their wet Cajun sauce and garlic butter wings. The Cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin. The sauce was also thin for the garlic butter, but that is more expected. They were better than average, but I don't like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat. I would definitely come try this place out again to sample some of the other items on the menu, but this will probably not become a regular stop for wings anytime soon.   \n","\n","   votes.cool             business_id  votes.funny  stars        date    type  \\\n","0           0  5UmKMjUEUNdYWqANhGckJw            0      4  2012-08-01  review   \n","1           0  5UmKMjUEUNdYWqANhGckJw            0      5  2014-02-13  review   \n","2           0  5UmKMjUEUNdYWqANhGckJw            0      5  2015-10-31  review   \n","3           0  UsFtqoBl7naz8AVUBZMjQQ            0      5  2013-11-08  review   \n","4           0  UsFtqoBl7naz8AVUBZMjQQ            0      3  2014-03-29  review   \n","\n","   votes.useful  \n","0             0  \n","1             0  \n","2             0  \n","3             0  \n","4             0  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-ec625b49-76c7-49aa-8c64-1bd806b4375a\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>user_id</th>\n","      <th>review_id</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>votes.cool</th>\n","      <th>business_id</th>\n","      <th>votes.funny</th>\n","      <th>stars</th>\n","      <th>date</th>\n","      <th>type</th>\n","      <th>votes.useful</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>PUFPaY9KxDAcGqfsorJp3Q</td>\n","      <td>Ya85v4eqdd6k9Od8HbQjyA</td>\n","      <td>Mr Hoagie is an institution.

speciality is the Italian Hoagie, and it is voted the best in the area year after year., Overall, its a good alternative to Subway, which is down the road., Excellent food., Superb customer service., I miss the mario machines they used to have, but it's still a great place steeped in tradition., But other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order., They also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good., They win pennysaver awards ever years i see why.]\n","1

is great here., But the best thing they have is their wings., Their wings are simply fantastic!!  , The \"Wet Cajun\" are by the best & most popular.  , I also like the seasoned salt wings.  , Wing Night is Monday & Wednesday night, $0.75 whole wings!\\n\\n, The dining area is nice., Very family friendly!, The bar is very nice is well.  , \"Pittsburgh Dad\" would love this place n'at!!, We have heard that their wings are great and decided it was finally time to check it out., Their wings are whole wings and crispy, which is a nice change of pace., They were better than average, but I don't like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat., Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  , The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better., The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  , The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent., Good bar food., Good service., \\n\\nLooking for a great Pittsburgh style fish sandwich, this is the place to go., The breading is light, fish is more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fries. \\n\\n, Great place for lunch or bar snacks and

issues., I am a big believer in first impressions, so when I go to a new business I pay close attention to how they treat me and how they run their business., Joe was very polite and friendly as soon as I met him, as was his shop assistant., I needed a CV joint installed as well as a new transmission mount., Joe was nice enough to estimate a fair price to install both, he honored that price, was fast, very friendly, and treated me like he knew me for years., It's a great neighborhood shop and Joe is a real nice guy who could have easily raked me over the coals, but he didn't., I know quite a bit about cars, and everything he told me was true., Give him a call, you'll be glad you did., Thanks Joe!]\n","3

[Decent range somewhat close to the city.  , The mats are pretty solid; however, the grass range needs to be tended too.  , It's like hitting out of US Open type rough...not very amenable to practicing.  , Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf range...Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?)., I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  , Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  , It is still light out.  , When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  , Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  , The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh., Before I finally made it over to this range I heard the same thing from most people - it's just fine to go work on your swing., It's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. \\n\\n, I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....\\n\\nPrice for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season., The new range looks amazing.  , The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  ]\n","4

from this agent today who was able to removed the extra charges on my bill that the Pasadena Verizon Store on Lake was charging me on my bill for upgrading my phone.   , Rob from the Pennsylvania store who i was connected today was able to look at my bill and all the notes and correct the problem immediately., Great Customer Service!, He even set up a FOLLOW UP Phone Call with me On July 5th to make sure the credit goes through on my bill..., Don't visit this store if you want pleasant or good service., The agent was pleasant and helpful., We went over to the Verizon store to see what was up, and that was about as pleasant as having forks jammed in my eyes., He didn't say there would be a wait or to sit or anything, just said \"okay then\" and left us., They were awesome.  ]\n","

breakfast ., Waiting for a table see 2 tables that have empty plates , made eye contact with servers no one notice us for 5 min until the guy cooking say something one of the waitress went and pick table , she didn't look like in a good mood already, we sat and  and order drinks she came like  4  min later and took order here where the fun begins., Finish coffee wanted more see her going to refill other customers bypass me until I asked for more she refill it., but she has to clean table ., Ok almost there, guess what ?, She forget my kids bacon so I call her ( my kid saying forget dad) and ask her not to charge me her bacon, her replied was I don't have u ticket yet, ok fine, Ok hang in there go pay at register customer ahead of me she pays, so I'm next girl walk away and leaves me there cash and ticket on hand, min go by so I ask her can u  charge me, she said, you have to wait , can u believe that?, Ok maybe this was my first and last  time at this Waffle House ., This place is awesome!, The waffles are the best waffles I have ever had in my entire life!, The waitresses were wonderful and so was the food., Excellent Waffle House experience with a crew that seemed to be pretty happy about being at work today though one of the customers decided to be an ass and rev his shitbox really loud for a couple of minutes., Anyway, my \"all star breakfast\" was good with two over easy eggs that were a little greasy, white bread (zero nutritional value), hash browns (\"covered\") and a waffle that turned out to be a little bit overdone., Yep, it was a positive WH

years., Way back when they were still in the original location at 16 and Hoskins., I like how they keep adding new things to the menu and this is one of the newer additions., Crisp, hot and fantastic., The tortilla was good and the cabbage added the traditional touch., Comes with chips, salsa, and really good queso., Decor is standard sports bar kitsch but the place is clean and vibrant, service is really good, and nearly everything I have had there has been extremely well done and consistent., ive heard nothing but good things about this restaurant from friends, neighbors and yelp....   , what a crappy restaurant...the food was mediocre at best..., my boyfriends burger looked good but wasnt that great...by the way... and if i wanted to complain to a manager or something i figured there was no point..., The several times I've been here or gotten food to go, it's just been ok.  , I've never been amazed by much here.  , It's a sports bar, for sure.  , I think most sports bars I've been to would get 3 stars from me, but a select few have good food.  , This place is just ok.\\n\\n, They are that good, in my opinion., If you're big on sports and drinking, this might be a fine place for you, but I've not been there for either of those on any occasion I've been.  , Yes the decor is dated, yes the food isnt amazing all the time, and yes this is a locals pub/restaurant., Honestly its really pretty decent place to pick up a meal.\\n\\n, When you first enter you can go to the left for the bar or right for the restaurant., The guaranteed winner every time is their Steak Salad its really tasty and filling., I've had their St. Louis Ribs and they are just ok., The service is friendly and my parents know most of the waitresses as they are regulars at the Sports Page. \\n\\n, I went to this location as part of a large party during the Highland Games nearby.  , Only when told by another member of our party did they get an apology, not just more excuses.  , The bread was indeed pressed, but having had Cuban sandwiches from places where they are quite real, those here are not.  , For food from a \"Sports Bar\" kind of place, keep looking., I enjoyed it tremendously, the service and food were phenomenal., They were beyond outstanding., Not being from charlotte I don't know every place that has O rings but this one is my favorite!  , Totally fantastic., Great food get there\\nr, Good food, good service, and just a great place to stop for lunch., Don't expect gourmet but instead expect a good bang for the buck place to stop for lunch., The steak sandwich is awesome !, Food is just OK, high turn over of employees who are terrified to make a mistake, they charge for extra sauce if you run out, food is not consistent never know when your going to get the same quality because the manager has no clue how to run a restaurant.]\n","1318

whatever....all is good-  and multiple types of potatoes...nice touch.  , Service is wonderful and lots of seats....so unlikely to have to wait, Today my co-workers dragged me to another place that they claimed had \"amazing food\"., Collards were good 4/5., My co-workers both got the hamburger steak with 2 sides each and they said it was very good., Anyways, the service was pretty good as they checked in with us often and brought us 2-3 refills.\\n\\n, Prices were very cheap - if your looking for an inexpensive \"home cooked\" type meal.\\n\\n, But you never know since my coworkers love to go to places like this for a \"plate lunch\"., The portions are perfect, I am always filled up(and I eat a lot)., Great country style family cooking., It's an awesome selection and they'll make the food exactly the way you ask them to!, Best breakfast in the area., Good food., Good service., Very clean., Reasonable prices.  , The service and staff are great people and they make you feel like your in grand ma's kitchen on a Sunday morning., Everyone speaks when you walk in and say goodbye when you leave and with the variety of meals on the menu and super low prices, When you want good old fashioned service and a hot country breakfast this is a sure hit., This place is outstanding and worth finding!  , \"Kendra\" was a great waitress and full of personality and beauty.  , Had breakfast special, Ok I figured this would be ordinary diner food at best, This was fantastic diner food.  , I had the Breakfast Special for $4.99 which came with two eggs, crispy bacon, home fries and a biscuit.  , I got lots and lots of perfectly crispy bacon!!!!  , The home fries were excellent and crisp.  , The biscuit was large and soft....great great great.  , Love the food and the atmosphere., The staff are exciting and entertaining and always make you feel like a valued customer., Im a huge fan of the breakfast meals., They are portioned just right for hard working men and women who may need the extra love., The menu offers an impressive list of foods to fit your needs and mood., Very spacious eating area, If you are in the city... better yet the state of North Carolina, you should

to be tended too.  , It's like hitting out of US Open type rough...not very amenable to practicing.  , Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf range...Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?)., I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  , Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  , It is still light out.  , When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  , Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  , The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh., Before I finally made it over to this range I heard the same thing from most people - it's just fine to go work on your swing., It's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. \\n\\n, I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....\\n\\nPrice for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season., The new range looks amazing.  , The entire range
